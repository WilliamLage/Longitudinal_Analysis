# Longitudinal_Analysis
An overview of Longitudinal Analysis with real world example

A powerpoint has been provided to give a topic overview and interpretation of the results of the dataset. 
The R-code has been included as a .rmd with the requisite dataset.
For those who'd like to preview the code without installing R it has been converted to a word document as well.
